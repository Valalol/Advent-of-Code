# The objective is to kinda like a nongram with only lines . are empty spaces # are filled spaces and ? are unknown spaces

# let "???.?" be our line and "1,1" be our blocks so here we have 4 possibilities
# we want to do it recursively

# if I put a # in the first ? then the second ? must be empty so the next step is to compute "?.?" and "1" as blocks
# in this case we have 2 possibilities (as we have 2 ?) so we have 2 possibilities

# then we skip the first ? and put # in the second ? so the next step is to compute ".?" and "1" as blocks
# in this case we have 1 possibility (as we have 1 ?) so we have 1 possibility

# then we skip the first two ? and put # in the third ? so the next step is to compute ".?" and "1" as blocks
# in this case we have 1 possibility (as we have 1 ?) so we have 1 possibility

# then we skip the first three ? and put # in the fourth ? so the next step is to compute "" and "1" as blocks
# in this case we have 0 possibility (as we have 0 ?) so we have 0 possibilities

# so we have 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 4 possibilities

# so our recursive stop condition is when we have only one block

# each recursive step we can compute the number of possibilities by using a for loop going from 0 to the number of ? in the line
# for each iteration we put a # in the ? and then we compute the number of possibilities of the remaining line and blocks
